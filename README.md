I used Python, HTML, and Javascript to create the website.
The website shows information movies and TV shows if you click them.

Details

**media.py**: This python script contains the movie and TV shows classes I used for this website.
- Video: This is the main class. It is divided into Movie and TvShow
- Movie: It contains everything included in Video plus trailer url.
- TvShow: It contains everything included in Video plus the number of seasons.

**entertainment_center.py**: This is the python scripts that creates instances for movies and TV shows. It uses the movie API to gather the movie data and saves the data into an array.

**fresh_tomatoes.py**: This script contains Javascript, HTML, and CSS scripts that creates .html file showing list of movies and TV shows created from **entertainment_center.py**.

Still In Progress

This project is not completed. I am trying to figure out getting movie data easily from movie API but couldn't find a good API yet. I will keep searching until I find a good one. If I don't find it, then I can just create instances manually.
